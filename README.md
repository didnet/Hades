# Hades
Hades is an practical decentralized identity system that supports privacy-preserving, full accountability and Fine-gained sybil-resistance.

## Structure

**contracts/manager.sol** is the Identity Contract can run on EVM-Powered chains.

**src/ca_client.rs** is a client for CA.

**src/committee_client.rs** is a client for the committee.

**src/user_client.rs** is a client for the users.

**circuits/xxx.circom** are zkp circuits written in Circom.

## How to build

### Installing dependency

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential
```

### Installing Rust

Hades SDK is written in Rust. To have Rust available in your system, you can install rustup. If youâ€™re using Linux or macOS, open a terminal and enter the following command:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```
### Installing circom (can skip)

Hades zkp circuits are written in circom. To have circom available in your system, you can install circom:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iden3/circom.git
cd circom
cargo build --release
cargo install --path circom
```

### Building circom (can skip)

```bash
circom --r1cs --wasm circuits/pseudonym_check.circom
circom --r1cs --wasm circuits/sybil_check.circom
circom --r1cs --wasm circuits/pedersen_commit.circom
circom --r1cs --wasm circuits/tpke_single.circom
```

### Building rust

```bash
cargo build --release
```

## Test and Benchmark

Hades is implemented using Rust and Solidity. We have already attached the test data and test accounts; you can use the following commands for testing and benchmark:

```bash
cargo test --package hades --test contract -- bench_all --exact --nocapture
```
