# Hades
Hades is a practical decentralized identity system that supports privacy-preserving, full accountability, and Fine-gained sybil-resistance.


## Structure

**contracts/manager.sol** is the Identity Contract that can run on EVM-Powered chains.

**src/ca_client.rs** is a client for CA.

**src/committee_client.rs** is a client for the committee.

**src/user_client.rs** is a client for the users.

**circuits/xxx.circom** are zero-knowledge circuits written in Circom.



## How to build

### Installing dependency

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential
```

### Installing Rust

Hades SDK is written in Rust. To have Rust available in your system, you can install rustup. If youâ€™re using Linux or macOS, open a terminal and enter the following command:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```
### Installing circom

Hades zkp circuits are written in circom. To have circom available in your system, you can install circom:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iden3/circom.git
cd circom
cargo build --release
cargo install --path circom
```

### Building circom

```bash
circom --r1cs --wasm circuits/pseudonym_check.circom
circom --r1cs --wasm circuits/sybil_check.circom
circom --r1cs --wasm circuits/pedersen_commit.circom
circom --r1cs --wasm circuits/tpke_single.circom
```

### Building Hades

```bash
https://github.com/didnet/Hades.git
cd Hades
cargo build --release
```



## Test and Benchmark

Hades is implemented using Rust and Solidity. 
To simplify the evaluation, we have consolidated all the processes into one test function and also provided some BSC Testnet accounts. 
The command listed below can be utilized to run the test.

```
cd Hades
cargo build --release
target/release/hades
```
OR
```bash
cargo test --package hades --test contract -- bench_all --exact --nocapture
```
Since the second method runs in debug mode, its evaluation results are not accurate (slower).

Below are the test results (in release model), which are presented in Tables 1 and Table 2 of the paper.
Note that due to differences in CPU performance, the test results may vary across different running platforms.
